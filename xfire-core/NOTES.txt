o We should pool/cache Types
o There is no support for multiple out parameters

o Ability to import XSD into WSDL?

Asynchronous Services
- xfire can execute a series of callbacks for a request
- these callbacks are dependent on how the invocation went
- how do we combine async and sync models?
- Cases
  - Normal synchronous req/res
  - Request with asynchronous or synchronous response depending on
    how the call proceeded
  - asychronous request/response
