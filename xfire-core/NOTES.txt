Channels:
- Easy to add features such as RM on top of channels

Whats a channel do?
- Sends messages
- Receives messages

For whom?
- A particular service

Where?
- At a particular URI/Endpoint

Where does the URI come from?
- The channel..

When?
- When a service is registered?

The "Async" case:
- createChannel(ServiceEndpoint endpoint) creates a listener at a particular uri/port
- send() always creates a new connection to the listener

The Synchronous "Server" case
- Service registered, a channel is created
- send() puts the message through the back channel

What if response goes somewhere else or there are multiple responses?
- send() recognizes this
