Due to the many preferences of people regarding build systems,
we seem to have ended up with 3: Ant, Maven 1.x, and Maven 2.x.
Here is a quick lineup of what works and what doesn't with each 
build:

Maven 1.1-beta-2:
- This is your best option for building XFire.
- Everything builds correctly
- This is the build system we are currently using to make release.
- It is possible to build a bundled xfire jar which combines all
  the modules into one. This can be done by doing:
  
  cd xfire-all && maven jar:jar
    
Maven 1.0.2: 
- Tests fail because of a bug with the maven class loader. Avoid.

Maven 2.0.2+:
- All the individual modules build
- Currently there is no way to build a bundled jar or make a 
  release.

Ant:
- This build is the *least supported*, but will work most of the 
  time. However, not all modules currently have ant builds. Use
  at your own risk.
