This example shows how to use XFire with Spring in a servlet container. 
You must have maven installed to build this example.  To build type:

$ maven war

The resultant war should work in any web application. The WSDL files
for the services should be viewable at:

http://yourhost:port/CONTEXT/Echo11Service?wsdl
http://yourhost:port/CONTEXT/Echo12Service?wsdl

where CONTEXT is the name of the context you deployed the war into 
(most likely "spring).
